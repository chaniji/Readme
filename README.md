"--Oh Wind, Wind! You that are more powerfull than the clouds, who are more             
 powerfull than the Sun, who is the most powerfull beeing on all Earth! Would
 you marry my daughter, who is the most wonderful, sweet, bright, gentle,
 courageous and beautiful mouse on the Kingdom?
 --I would be glad to do so... but alas! I am not that powerfull... when you
 will travel back to your land, you will surly see this old tower on the
 castle on the castle of the neighbour Kingdom... for centuries and centuries
 I have vainly blowed on him.. and never would he mouve! This old tower is
 surly more powerful than I."

"The King decided to go see this tower and ask him to marry his daughter,
 since it was right on his way back to home:"
