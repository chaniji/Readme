"--I would be glad to do so, but alas! I am not that powerfull... look, look!
 here in my undergrounds, a prince mouse has made hundred of holes in me, and
 never, never have i been able to stop him to do so! Surly he is more powerful
 than I am."

"The King was very desesperate by that time... he decided to make a last
 attempt and walked in the labyriths of path and holes of the undergrounds of
 the tower to find the prince mouse. After a few times, he met him:"

"--Oh Mr the prince Mouse.. You that are more powerful than the Tower, who is
 more powerful himself than the Wind, who is more powerful than the clouds,
 who is more powerful than the Sun, who is the most powerful beeing on Earth!
 Would you marry my daughter.. who is the most wonderful, sweet, bright, gentle
 courageous and beautiful mouse on my Kingdom?"
